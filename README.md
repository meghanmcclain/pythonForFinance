# pythonForFinance

I'm very interested in finance and the stock market.
I'm going to upload files involving python and finance here.

I recently read the book "Trade like a Stock Market Wizard" 
by Mark Minervini. Mark's book made me want to create a stock screener that picks
stocks based on his 8 conditions. 

I watched several YouTube videos by Richard Moglen on 
finance and python. I uploaded code discussed in 
Richard's YouTube videos here.

Here's Richard's YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/RichardMoglen
